                    <h4>Summary</h4>

                    <p>The Bowen Fascial Release Technique is a soft tissue, gentle remedial therapy. Rolling type moves are applied to precise points on the body over muscle, ligament, tendon and fascia, prompting the brain to reset, repair and balance
                        the body. The treatment is gentle, subtle and deeply relaxing.</p>

                            <div id="p1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                                <div class="panel-body">
                                    <p>Optimal alignment and function of our bodies depends on balanced muscular tension. Injuries, poor posture, emotional stress, illnesses and countless other influences will lead to incorrect tension in our soft tissues
                                        leaving our bodies mal aligned, leading to different aches and pains and internal, systemic problems.</p>

                                    <p>A Bowen move will stimulate particular receptors, connecting the brain directly to the area of the problem, allowing the body to reset “incorrect tension” in the soft tissue and thus regain optimum function. At the
                                        same time it rebalances the Autonomic Nervous System promoting physical and emotional healing. Bowen does not force the body to change, rather it acts as a catalyst to the body recognising its own imbalances and
                                        making the changes itself, thereby inducing effective and long lasting results. The gentle approach of Bowen ensures that the body goes into a deep relaxation mode, allowing itself to repair, rather than an on-guard,
                                        protective mode

                                    <p>Common presenting problems include back and neck pain, whiplash, knee problems, sports injuries, RSI, frozen shoulder, tennis elbow and respiratory conditions. Conditions such as chronic fatigue, hayfever, headache,
                                        kidney problems, and problems requiring lymphatic drainage respond favourably to The Bowen Technique.</p>

                                    <p>Some people use the Bowen Technique as a means of stress management and health maintenance, seeing their therapist 4 - 10 times a year.</p>

                                    <p>Bowen can be incredibly helpful to ladies during pregnancy as the body is undergoing constant change and adaptations which can sometimes lead to joint and muscle pains including Symphysis Pubis Dysfunction, Low Back
                                        Pain, Sciatic Pain and high blood pressure. Bowen can help to keep the pelvis aligned and will help to address any muscular imbalance, as well as promoting deep relaxation to aid both physical and emotional healing
                                        by balancing the Autonomic Nervous System.

                                    <p>Common childhood ailments including bedwetting, colic, glue ear, constipation, sleep disturbances, asthma and anxiety, respond very well and often quickly to Bowen.</p>

                                    <p>As a therapy, Bowen is truly light-touch. The pressure used in Bowen is quite subtle and extremely light. It is not dependent on hard pressure and there is no awkward bending, twisting or re-positioning of the client
                                        during the treatment. Because of this, Bowen can be considered for clients for whom other forms of therapy might be too aggressive, forceful or invasive. The tiniest of babies through to the frailest of adults have
                                        been treated with Bowen. And pregnant ladies too.</p>

                                        structure, he intuitively began working with this gentle technique discovering that certain moves on the body helped recovery from many conditions. His work in his popular clinic in Geelong, was verified by the
                                        1975 Victorian Government Inquiry into alternative health care professions.</p>
