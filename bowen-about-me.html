                                <p>My journey with The Bowen Technique started over 10 years ago.</p>

                                <p>An old school friend invited me along to a Bowen Technique taster session weekend, a therapy I had not heard of, but I was keen to learn something new so went along. I was so bowled over by its light touch and effectiveness,
                                    I signed up to complete the course there and then.</p>

                                <p>I have always had a keen interest in the human body, food and healthy living and have been studying it in one form or another since my teenage years. After 18 years working within the food industry in sales and marketing,
                                    I had a light bulb moment, and decided to follow what I really loved and enjoyed, so I left my job and set up my business as a Bowen Therapist.</p>

                                <p>I keep my skills up to date by attending regular Continuous Professional Development courses (CPD) including full human body dissections. These courses are a continuous reminder to me just how amazing our bodies are.</p>

                                <p><q>I had never experienced Bowen before I went to see Mary Lou and didnâ€™t know much about it as an alternative therapy. I am now a Bowen convert! I have never felt so relaxed in my life (that alone was worth the session!) and the niggles with my knee vanished overnight.
                                Mary Lou is lovely, extremely professional, knows her stuff, and keeps you informed every step of the way. I highly recommend her.

Weâ€™re heading towards a diagnosis of ADHD and he can be a fidgety child, but he was very still and calm on your table.

After only one session she was able to greatly help with my scoliosis, which years of osteopathy and chiropractic treatments had been unable to do.   Notwithstanding the incredible results, Mary Lou has a wonderful gentle and caring manner and the treatments always felt restorative and relaxing.
